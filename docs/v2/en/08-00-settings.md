# Preferences

The settings are divided into the following categories

* General
* Blog / Posts
* Shop
* Events
* Labels


* Customize Database
* Update

## General

Save the standard metadata here. All information can be overwritten later by individual
pages or products etc.

### RSS Time offset
You can set a time offset here. This prevents posts from ending up in the RSS feed immediately.

### Number of page versions
Every time you update a page, SwiftyEdit saves the overwritten version.
This allows you to switch back to an older version if you have made a mistake.
Here you can specify how many versions of a page should be saved.

## Blog
These settings affect the blog.

## Shop
Here you can specify whether the shopping cart function is active and/or whether items are sold.
You can also enter information on tax rates, shipping and delivery areas.

## Events
Here you will find the default settings for the event module. For example, you can specify whether the guest lists
should be activated.

## Labels
Most entries and data in the Backend can be provided with labels.
If you manage a lot of data and entries, these labels help you to keep an overview.

## Customize database
Here you can add further fields to the database (pages and users).

## Update
If a newer version is available for installation, it will be displayed here.

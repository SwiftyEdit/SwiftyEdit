# Shop

<kbd>Backend</kbd> <kbd>Shop</kbd>

Via the store module you can present and sell your products.

## Create products

Click on the <kbd>+ Product</kbd> button in the top right corner of the frontend.
In the following input mask you can enter all necessary details about your product.

## Digital products

You can also offer digital products (e.g. eBooks).
Upload your document via the file management and select this file here.
Of course you can also attach free files to a product.


## Features

Features are listed in the frontend. The default theme shows these details in a table.
The title is displayed in the left column and the text in the right column.

If a new product is created, the feature can simply be adopted.
However, you can overwrite the feature (i.e. the text) created here in each product.


## Optionen

Options contain a title and at least two values.
If an option is assigned to a product, the customer can select these options during the ordering process.

Options do not affect the price of the product. If, for example, you want to offer a product
which is available in two options at different prices, this must be created as a variant.


# Creating variants

To create a variant, you must duplicate an existing product and then save it as a variant.

1. In the product overview, click on Duplicate for the desired product.
2. Add the desired changes.
3. Click on ‘Save as variant’

## Variant title and description

When editing a variant, you can enter a separate color, title and description in the ‘Variants’ tab.
This information is displayed, for example, in the variant selection.

In many themes, this is a drop-down menu or a list with thumbnails.

## Variant type

__Page__ creates a separate URL for each variant.
__Parameter__ does not create a URL, but links the variants using the ID.

### When should I choose which variant type?

The variant type determines how search engines treat the product variants.
If you choose __Page__ as the variant type, SwiftyEdit creates a separate URL for this variant.
Search engines therefore expect different content. This carries the risk
of duplicate content and too many pages being submitted.

If the variant differs only minimally from the parent product, __Parameter__ is the right choice.

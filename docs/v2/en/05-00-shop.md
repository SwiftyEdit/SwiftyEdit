# Shop

<kbd>Backend</kbd> <kbd>Shop</kbd>

Via the store module you can present and sell your products.

## Create products

Click on the <kbd>+ Product</kbd> button in the top right corner of the frontend.
In the following input mask you can enter all necessary details about your product.

## Digital products

You can also offer digital products (e.g. eBooks).
Upload your document via the file management and select this file here.
Of course you can also attach free files to a product.


## Features

Features are listed in the frontend. The default theme shows these details in a table.
The title is displayed in the left column and the text in the right column.

If a new product is created, the feature can simply be adopted.
However, you can overwrite the feature (i.e. the text) created here in each product.


## Optionen

Options contain a title and at least two values.
If an option is assigned to a product, the customer can select these options during the ordering process.

Options do not affect the price of the product. If, for example, you want to offer a product
which is available in two options at different prices, this must be created as a variant.


# Creating variants

To create a variant, you must duplicate an existing product and then save it as a variant.

1. In the product overview, click on Duplicate for the desired product.
2. Add the desired changes.
3. Click on ‘Save as variant’

## Variant title and description

When editing a variant, you can enter a separate color, title and description in the ‘Variants’ tab.
This information is displayed, for example, in the variant selection.

In many themes, this is a drop-down menu or a list with thumbnails.

## Variant type

__Page__ creates a separate URL for each variant.
__Parameter__ does not create a URL, but links the variants using the ID.

### When should I choose which variant type?

The variant type determines how search engines treat the product variants.
If you choose __Page__ as the variant type, SwiftyEdit creates a separate URL for this variant.
Search engines therefore expect different content. This carries the risk
of duplicate content and too many pages being submitted.

If the variant differs only minimally from the parent product, __Parameter__ is the right choice.


### Sorting search results (relevance)

The order of products is determined based on a relevance rating.
The more accurate the search term, the higher the product appears.

The rating is based on the following criteria:

1.    __Exact match of the product URL (slug)__<br>
      Products whose URL exactly matches the search term are given the highest rating.
2.    __Partial match of the product URL__<br>
      If the search term is contained in the product URL, the product appears high up in the list.
3.    __Match in the product title__<br>
      Matches in the title are considered highly relevant and are prioritized accordingly.
4.    __Match in the product text__<br>
      Matches in the product description are also taken into account, but after the URL and title.
5.    __Other text fields & meta data__<br>
      Matches in teaser texts, additional fields, or SEO data are included in the search but have less influence on the sorting.
6.    __Product priority__<br>
      If several products have similar relevance, the manually assigned product priority decides.
      Products with higher priority are displayed higher up.

In short: Products are first evaluated according to the accuracy of the
search hit (URL → title → text).
If the relevance is the same, product priority decides.

To make products easy to find, we recommend:

- using meaningful product URLs
- setting clear, search-relevant titles
- placing important terms in the description text and meta data
- using product priority in a targeted manner

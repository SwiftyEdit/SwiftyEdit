# User management

There are two ways in which user accounts can be created.
Users can register themselves independently via the frontend
(if this function is enabled in the settings), or the user account is created via the backend.

If a user registers via the frontend,
he has to confirm his account. I.e., he must click the confirmation link,
which is automatically sent to his e-mail address.

## The (user) rights management

SwiftyEdit has effective rights management for visitors, moderators and administrators.

Each user or administrator can be equipped with different user rights.
The individual options can be found under <kbd>Users</kbd> <kbd>Edit user</kbd> in the tab
Password & rights management.

### Customise translations / texts

Changes to the language files are not recommended as they are reset with every update. There are two ways to change the language files:

* Request changes in the official [translation at Crowdin](https://de.crowdin.com/project/swiftyedit)
* Use a plugin to replace / extend the language files (for example the `alp` plugin)

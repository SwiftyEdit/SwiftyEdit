The possibilities of how snippets can be used are limitless. 
Whenever you need certain text phrases more than once, they can be saved as a snippet and then used via shortcode.

The snippets can be found under <kbd>ACP</kbd> <kbd>Contents</kbd> <kbd>Snippets</kbd>. Here all snippets are listed. 
You can sort the list, filter it by language and of course search it. 
With the labels you bring order into it, if you work with very many snippets.

__Advice:__ The snippets are multilingual. When you use a multilingual page, 
the snippet with the appropriate language is always loaded into your content. 
If the snippet is not available in the desired language, the snippet in the default language is automatically loaded.

# Creating variants

To create a variant, you must duplicate an existing product and then save it as a variant.

1. In the product overview, click on Duplicate for the desired product.
2. Add the desired changes.
3. Click on ‘Save as variant’

## Variant title and description

When editing a variant, you can enter a separate color, title and description in the ‘Variants’ tab.
This information is displayed, for example, in the variant selection.

In many themes, this is a drop-down menu or a list with thumbnails.

## Variant type

__Page__ creates a separate URL for each variant.
__Parameter__ does not create a URL, but links the variants using the ID.

### When should I choose which variant type?

The variant type determines how search engines treat the product variants.
If you choose __Page__ as the variant type, SwiftyEdit creates a separate URL for this variant.
Search engines therefore expect different content. This carries the risk
of duplicate content and too many pages being submitted.

If the variant differs only minimally from the parent product, __Parameter__ is the right choice.

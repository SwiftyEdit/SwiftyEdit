SwiftyEdit has a separate URL structure for each page type.
Example: /profile/ for the profile page or /checkout/ for the shopping cart.
If you want to customize these pages/URLs, you can simply create new pages and adjust the usage type accordingly.

#### Normal Page

This is the default value and is used for all pages that do not serve a specific purpose.

#### Register

This page is used to create new users.

#### Profile

Here, users can change their account details (contact information, password, etc.).

#### Search

The page for search results

#### Reset Password

#### 404 (Page not found)

#### Display Posts / Products / Events

As soon as you create a page with this usage type, all entries from the Blog, Shop, and Events modules
are displayed on this page.

For example, if you have multiple catalog pages (i.e., pages listing products from the shop)
on which identical products are listed, you can display all products on the /details/ page.

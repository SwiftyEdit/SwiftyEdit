# Events

You can advertise events or offer tickets using the event module.
All existing events are listed on the overview. On the right you will find filters and
more options to sort the list. You can also show or hide past events here.

### Create or edit events

Click on the button <kbd>+ Create new entry</kbd> to get to the input mask for new events.
If you would like to edit an existing entry, simply click on the "Edit" symbol next to the entry.

As usual, you can enter a title, a short description, a preview image and further information for each event
register. The most important event data is...

* <kbd>Beginning</kbd> Here YOU specify when the event begins
* and <kbd>End</kbd> Here you enter the date when the event ends.

This information is responsible, among other things, for sorting your events.

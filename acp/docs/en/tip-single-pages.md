Single pages (sometimes called unordered pages) are not included in the navigation - 
but are still included in the sitemap or search results.
The unordered pages are listed in the right column.

Using the filter function, the list can be filtered by status (Public, Invisible, Private, Draft),
by labels and by languages. Additionally, you can filter the list via the search field.

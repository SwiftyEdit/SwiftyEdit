Here you can define features and options for your products.

## Features

Features are listed in the frontend. The default theme shows these details in a table.
The title is displayed in the left column and the text in the right column.

If a new product is created, the feature can simply be adopted.
However, you can overwrite the feature (i.e. the text) created here in each product.


## Optionen

Options contain a title and at least two values.
If an option is assigned to a product, the customer can select these options during the ordering process.

Options do not affect the price of the product. If, for example, you want to offer a product
which is available in two options at different prices, this must be created as a variant.

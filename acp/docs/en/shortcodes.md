# Manage Shortcodes

<kbd>Backend</kbd> <kbd>Contents</kbd> <kbd>Shortcodes</kbd>

Shortcodes work similar to snippets. The system automatically searches your content for shortcodes and 
replaces them with the defined "longcode".

On the left side the already saved shortcodes are listed. On the right side you will find the form to 
edit the codes or to create new shortcodes.

### Input fields

<kbd>Shortcode</kbd> Enter your desired shortcode here. You should think of a pattern, 
so that you always immediately recognize that it is a shortcode. The square brackets have proven to be useful here. 
Example: `[shortcode]`

<kbd>Replacement</kbd> Here you specify what your shortcode should be replaced with in the frontend.

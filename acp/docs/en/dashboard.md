# Dashboard

Here you can find all the information about your website at a glance.

The latest entries are listed on the left-hand side.
You can click directly on the individual entries to edit them.
You can also create new entries directly.

On the right-hand side you will find a log, current warnings and information on the software used.

Tip: If you are working on a theme or similar and have not activated the “Smarty Compile Check” option,
you can also clear the Smarty cache here.

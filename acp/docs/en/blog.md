# Blog

<kbd>Backend</kbd> <kbd>Blog</kbd>

Here you can manage your blog. Create, edit or delete entries.
On the overview you will find all saved entries.

There are 5 different types of blog posts.

* Messages
* Images
* Galleries
* Video
* Link
* Download

## Create new entry

Once you have decided on a type, an input mask will be displayed. 
Here you can enter the data like e.g. title, a short description and a thumbnail.

### Specifics

#### Status

You can choose between <kbd>Public</kbd> and <kbd>Draft</kbd>. Public entries are listed in the frontend 
and can be seen by all visitors. Drafts are also displayed in the frontend, but only administrators can see them.

#### Priority / Fix at the top

Normally the entries are sorted by date (Publish on). Here only the day and the hour
are taken into account. If you want to re-sort several entries of a day, you can control this via the priority.
The higher the priority, the higher the entry will appear.

#### Publish on ...

If you write entries in advance, but they should appear later on your homepage,
you can set a date and time for each entry.

#### Others

The most important meta data of your entry will be generated automatically. 
Via the <kbd>Meta Data</kbd> tab you can customize them according to your requests.

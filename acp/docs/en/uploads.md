# Upload & manage files

Here you can upload images and files and manage the ones you have already uploaded.
You can save information about each uploaded file.

### Upload files

You can open the upload form via the link at the bottom right of the screen.

By selecting "Choose destination folder" you determine where your upload should be stored.
If you upload files with identical filenames, SwiftyEdit will number the files automatically.
If you activate the option "Overwrite existing", of course not.

Which file types you can upload is shown below the window.
The list can only be extended or edited via the config.php file.

SwiftyEdit gives you two default directories (images and files).
Within these directories you can create as many subdirectories as you want.
